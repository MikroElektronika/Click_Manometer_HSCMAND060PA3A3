# Click_Manometer_HSCMAND060PA3A3
Manometer click is an add-on board with a piezoresistive silicon pressure sensor. The onboard Honeywell HSCMAND060PA3A3 module has an industry-leading, extremely high accuracy of ±0.25%FSS BFSL. A wide pressure range from ±1.6 mbar to ±10 bar makes it suitable for a variety applications. Beyond the measurement range, the sensor has a high burst pressure threshold, resulting in increased reliability. The barbed port accepts 4.93 mm (0.19”) tubing. Manometer click communicates with the target board MCU through the mikroBUS™ I2C interface (SCL, SDA). Manometer click uses a 3.3V power supply.
